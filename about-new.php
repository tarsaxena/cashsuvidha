        <p align="justify" style="margin-top:30px; font-style:italic; margin-bottom:30px;">A major group of entrepreneurs in India faces a steady struggle in moving their business towards the changing aspects of the market, as they undergo certain challenges in floating their bank loans; external factors like inflexible guarantee parameters, frustrating lending policies and lengthy disbursements affect their loan appeals. Owing to the never ending process parameters, timely credit has turned into a matter of a headache. Enlistment of personal property is undesired when this is done to raise a business fund.</p>
        <p align="justify">All of us expect smooth loan approval policies which are blessed with quick application acceptance procedures. Initiated by the demand from manufacturers, service providers and traders, many non-banking financial companies (NBFC) have engaged in providing micro, small, medium and large business loans in recent years.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Cash Suvidha</strong> is a trade name of <strong>Usha Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.</strong> Here, we invite you for a safe, scheduled and sophisticated business loan in order to maintain a sustainable growth. We're driven by information based lending, online application acceptance, best-in-industry interest rate and viability based financing.</p>
        <p align="justify">Apart from stirring the journeys of budding and longstanding entrepreneurs, <strong>Cash Suvidha</strong>, also deals with women empowerment on a micro level. Place your assignment in the right place; making differences and meeting expectations are within your reach.</p>
       <br/><br/> 
        <h5><b>Our Vision</b></h5>
 <p align="justify"><strong>Cash Suvidha</strong>, has come up with an idea to meet the market gap that's not allowing the visionaries in uplifting their dreams towards the real touch of business world - the establishment or enlargement of a profit-making agency. Here we aim in inspiring and encouraging those people who expect to drive their self-dependency. We are deeply committed to help you by providing business capital and hence reassuring you for success. Once we decide to deal with a person or an organization, we trail the relation up to an unlimited period.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h5><b>Our Mission</b></h5>
 <p align="justify">Our mission is to help the ambitious people by providing them a wide range of loans including <strong><a href="http://www.cashsuvidha.com/entrepreneur-loan.php">entrepreneur loan</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.cashsuvidha.com/sme-loan.php">SME Loan</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.cashsuvidha.com/invoice-finance.php">invoice finance</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.cashsuvidha.com/women-loan.php">women empowerment loan</a></strong>.

Our company is prudent and punctual in the disbursement of loans that are blessed with smooth lending policies as well as best-in-the-industry interest rates. In that agenda, we have established a strong foundation of brilliance that's further segmented into two dissimilar units - the core team and the advisory team.</p>
